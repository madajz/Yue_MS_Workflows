# Yue_MS_Workflows
Two sets of ~10 data frames from the mass spec core, each containing several different tissues. Mike has already processed these data in some capacity so the data should already be blank adjusted and run-order drift accounted for.  For the first set (Yue_HFD) groups are:  diet, sex, genotypes (WT, KI) and the second set (Yue_metabolomics, ie the banana data) the groups are sex, brain region, and genotype (WT/WT, WT/KI, KI/KI). For both sets of analyses we will produce a standardized workflow (1 for each set of data) that Yue can run all her data through. In both workflows we will initially include the following plots: PCAs, heatmaps, venn diagrams, volcano plots, and boxplots of the top 10 or so differentially abundant compounds per contrast.

Hi @Yue Ma, Below is a quick summary of our meeting. Let us know if we missed anything or if you have nay concerns at this time. 

All our best,
Zach

Two sets of ~10 data frames from the mass spec core, each containing several different tissues. Mike has already processed these data in some capacity so the data should already be blank adjusted and run-order drift accounted for.  For the first set (Yue_HFD) groups are:  diet, sex, genotypes (WT, KI) and the second set (Yue_metabolomics, ie the banana data) the groups are sex, brain region, and genotype (WT/WT, WT/KI, KI/KI). For both sets of analyses we will produce a standardized workflow (1 for each set of data) that Yue can run all her data through. In both workflows we will initially include the following plots: PCAs, heatmaps, venn diagrams, volcano plots, and boxplots of the top 10 or so differentially abundant compounds per contrast. We are also more than happy to add more plots in the future.  Workflows will be shared via Github for easier version control.

Comparisons for Yue_HFD: 

WT LFD vs. KI LFD

WT HFD vs. KI HFD

delta delta comparison for [KI HFD vs. LFD]  vs. [WT HFD vs. LFD]

Comparison for Yue_metabolomics (the banana data)

2 types of analyses: pooled sexes, and then stratified by sex; both of these analyses will be stratified by brain region

there are 3 genotypes KI, WT, Het â€“ Compare all 3 to each other (interested in the het effect and the double mutant effect relative to the WT, but also want to know if the double mutant differs from the het).
